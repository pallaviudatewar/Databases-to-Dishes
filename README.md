Challenges encountered:
-Evaluation of our recipe?
RLHF
-Mixture of two ingredients that donâ€™t go together and give stomach ache?
DISCLAIMER : You should go through the ingredients list and not rely on AI generated recipes.

Show comparison of our recipe generated using our retreiver vs the recipe generated by the LLM
One recipe will be generated by the LLM(without any knowledge base). One recipe will be generated by our architecture. How do you show our recipe is better
- Evaluation can be done using RLHF to compare recipes generated by generator only and generator embedded with the retriever and comparison can be done by qualified individuals to compare which recipe is superior.

Comparison of Generator Models - Why did you choose X generator:
We experimented with different generator models such as 
GPT-2
Llama-2
GPT-3.5/4 (ChatGpt/ChatGPT Pro)
GPT 4 is a powerful generator model for x,y,z reasons.
